            <ul>
              <h1><em>Be on the lookout for...</em></h1>
              <br>
						  <li>Fluency in Japanese.  Intending to lie low in Japan for a few months until the heat was off him, the suspect remained there for seven years, learning the language in two and finding a deep understanding of the culture and customs.  Our informants tell us he is moving on to programming languages next...</li><br/>
						  <li>An ability to absorb the world around him.  The suspect has had no formal study of the Japanese language, and has learned it purely by immersion and exposure.  Watch for a chameleon who can fit seamlessly into any situation or group.</li><br/>
						  <li>Flexibility. Whatever the situation, the suspect appears to be able to adapt and change to suit his needs.  Could prove to be a difficult catch.</li><br/>
					    <li>Passion. Lacking any prior knowledge of the native language, the suspect moved to the other side of the world simply because he was interested in the country.  Any challenge will be met with unparalelled commitment, dedication, and maybe even a touch of recklessness.</li><br/>
						  <li>A team player.  The suspect has been a member of different teams for years and has no problem getting along with anyone, having had experience with coworkers from around the world, and making lifelong friendships in the process.  <em>Beware his many accomplices.</em></li><br/>
						  <li>An independant streak.  Living away from friends and family for years at a time, the suspect works well on his own as well, and is perfectly capable, and comfortable with doing things on his own, in his own way.</li><br/>
						  <li>Tech skills.  Working knowledge of Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS, CSS3, Bootstrap and many more.  Suspect should be forbidden access to computers.</li>
